## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for our Pizza Delivery App! This document provides information about the key features and functionalities of the app.

## Features

### Add to Cart

The "Add to Cart" feature allows users to add their favorite pizza items to the shopping cart. To use this feature, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the menu section.
2. Browse through the available pizza options.
3. Click the "Add to Cart" button next to the desired item.
4. The selected item will be added to the shopping cart.

### Quick View

The "Quick View" feature provides a convenient way for users to get a brief overview of a pizza item without leaving the current page. Here's how to use it:

1. Hover over the pizza item you want to view.
2. Click the "Quick View" icon (e.g., an eye symbol).
3. A pop-up window will display essential details about the selected item.

### Data Fetching from API

Our app fetches pizza menu data from a dedicated API, ensuring that users always have access to the latest and most accurate information. The API endpoints are detailed in the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section.

### Delivery Confirmation

After successfully placing an order, users will receive a delivery confirmation to ensure a smooth and transparent experience. The confirmation includes:

- Order details
- Estimated delivery time
- Contact information for customer support

## Usage Examples

Below are some usage examples to help you understand how to interact with the app:

```javascript
// Adding an item to the cart
const selectedItem = menuItems[0];
cart.addToCart(selectedItem);

// Quick view functionality
const pizzaToQuickView = menuItems[1];
quickView.showQuickView(pizzaToQuickView);

// Fetching data from the API
const menuData = await fetchMenuFromAPI();
console.log(menuData);

// Confirming delivery
const orderConfirmation = confirmDelivery(orderDetails);
console.log(orderConfirmation);
